## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps us understand the survey data better. It helps us understand the trends in the data science industry with the help of the data that we are provided.Through different metrics we get to know what the salaries of people in the data domain are according to their specific roles and whether people are happy with their current positions. It also lets us know how difficult it was for people to break into Data Science and what programming languages people preferred.
